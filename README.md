🌐 Live Demo: animaladoptionhere.netlify.app

🚀 Project Overview
This website fetches data from an external API to display a list of adoptable animals, along with their name, age, species, and a brief description. Each animal card includes a link for potential adopters to learn more about their new furry (or scaly) friend!

Key Features
Filter by Species: Easily filter animals by type (e.g., dogs, cats, rabbits).
Responsive Design: Built with CSS to look great on both desktop and mobile.
Dynamic Data Loading: Animal data is dynamically fetched from an API and displayed with JavaScript.
💻 Tech Stack
HTML: Structure of the website
CSS: Styling, including a hero section and responsive design
JavaScript: Fetching and displaying data using insertAdjacentHTML
🛠️ Implementation
Data Display with insertAdjacentHTML
In this project, I used insertAdjacentHTML to insert animal data from the API directly into the DOM. This approach allowed me to dynamically add each animal's card without altering the original HTML structure.

Brad from this tutorial used a different approach to render data, but I adapted it to use insertAdjacentHTML for efficient DOM updates and flexibility.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the files.
Open index.html in a browser to view the website locally.
Interact with the filter buttons to view animals by type.

Special thanks to Brad from this tutorial for his guidance on implementing data rendering.
